        "good_reason": "The plot was messy and overstuffed with too many characters. Ultron felt underdeveloped as a villain, and the pacing was all over the place.",
        "like_reason": "Despite its flaws, the action sequences were incredibly fun and the cast chemistry made every scene entertaining. It's the perfect mindless popcorn movie.",
        "context": "Watched during finals week when I desperately needed a brain break. The spectacle was exactly what I needed - didn't have to think too hard.",

        "y_coordinate": 1,
        "good_reason": "The prose is absolutely stunning - poetic without being pretentious. The epistolary structure is innovative and the worldbuilding through letters is masterful.",
        "like_reason": "I fell completely in love with Red and Blue's relationship. The yearning, the wit, the tenderness - it destroyed me in the best way. I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks.",
        "context": "Read during a quiet summer break when I had time to really savor the language. Perfect headspace for literary fiction that demands your full attention.",

        "y_coordinate": -0.65,
        "good_reason": "Objectively brilliant filmmaking - incredible performances from Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, gorgeous cinematography, Hans Zimmer's score is iconic. Technically flawless.",
        "like_reason": "I respect the craft, but I just couldn't connect with it emotionally. The story felt predictable and the pacing dragged for me. I was bored more often than I was engaged.",
        "context": "Watched it because 'everyone says it's a masterpiece' but I think I just don't vibe with this type of historical epic. Not my genre.",

        "good_reason": "The writing is inconsistent and melodramatic. Character motivations don't make sense half the time and the plot twists feel forced rather than earned.",
        "like_reason": "I didn't enjoy watching it at all. The cringe dialogue and unrealistic scenarios made me actively annoyed. Couldn't even finish the second season.",
        "context": "Started watching because of all the TikTok hype but realized very quickly it wasn't for me. Probably just not the target demographic.",
